Create a group with max 3 ppl , 

Create your own project application using your own idea,

The application should be useful and can be used in daily process. 
The application requirement are :
-> Read and write File, file requirement is having minimum 5 attributes for one file, preferable using struct to store data. // done
-> There should be 2 or more file application in different usage, e.g list student.txt and student score history.txt and so on. // done
-> Sorting, can be sorted using 3 different of data type, and could be ascending or descending. // done
-> searching, two type searching using exact key , and pick one option: 
1. contains the keyword if using string key search , e.g  (preferable)
list data :
anderson , amelia, derian , georion . 
ex 1 ,<contains key> : ri , show derian , georion
ex 2 ,<starts key> : a, show : anderson , amelia
ex 3 ,<ends key> : an, show : derian 
2. filter < and > keyword if using number key search, e.g 
list data : 
10,30,20,40,70,60,50 
ex 1, < more than key> : 45 , show : 50, 60 ,70 
ex 1, < less than key> : 45 , show : 10, 20 ,30 ,40
-> Logic, use proper kind of validation and at least have string validation and number validation
have 2 process logic, and one of them should applied recursive process method. 

This case will be need to be presented for the usage and the feature have been made in the apps.
