						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>
							Personality typing is a system of categorizing people according to
							their tendencies to think and act in particular ways. Personality
							typing attempts to find the broadest, most important ways in which
							people are different, and make sense of these differences by
							sorting people into meaningful groups. The most popular and
							well-known system of personality typing was developed by Isabel
							<br />
							<br />
							Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, in the 1960's.
							Myers and Briggs built on the personality theories of Swiss
							psychiatrist Dr. Carl Jung as outlined in his book, Psychological
							Types, and developed one of the world's most popular personality
							assessments, the Myers Briggs Type Indicator®, or MBTI®.

						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>
							From early in her life, Katharine Cook Briggs was captivated by
							Jung’s theory of psychological types. However, she recognized that
							the theory as Jung explained it was too diffuse and complex for
							use by regular people. She therefore set out to convey Jung’s
							ideas in a simple way so that anyone would be able to recognize
							personality types in action in everyday life.

						<h2>The Basics</h2>
						<p>
							The Myers-Briggs system describes a person’s personality through
							four opposing personality functions, variously known as
							dichotomies, preferences or scales. The first three preferences
							are based on the writings of Jung; Katherine Cook Briggs added the
							final preference, Judging versus Perceiving, based on her own
							observations.
